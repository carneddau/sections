'Short River Names File
'Enter a 4 character name for each river in the format SHORT_RIVERNAME1=NAME
'This can be used with the chainage to create an ID for each section
'e.g. ORIN.01145 (Orinoco ch 1145)
'Where an existing "NewRiverIDFormat.ini" file is found the 1st 4 characters have been entered automatically.
' - edit as necessary.
N.B. These names Must be UNIQUE. As they are generated automatically they could be identical.
e.g. AFON is common  in Wales so the software renames repeats to AFO2, AF03 etc.

PLEASE NOTE the number at the end of the record id e.g. SHORT_RIVERNAME2 has nothing to do
with River Numbers, though they will often coincide.
The first river name will always be SHORT_RIVERNAME1 whatever the river number.

SHORT_RIVERNAME1=RIV1
SHORT_RIVERNAME2=TRI1
SHORT_RIVERNAME3=RIV2
SHORT_RIVERNAME4=RIV3
SHORT_RIVERNAME5=RIV4
